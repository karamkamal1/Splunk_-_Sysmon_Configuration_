# SPLUNK & SYSMON CONFIGURATION

## Splunk Summary
In this lab, I successfully installed Ubuntu 24.04.1 as a dedicated Splunk server. It involved installing Splunk Enterprise on the Ubuntu server via the command line, configuring a static IP address through the netplan utility, and ensuring connection with the Domain Controller for DNS and routing. I also demonstrated how to secure access by changing user permissions and utilized the web interface for Splunk to confirm the installation was succesful.

Once the Splunk server was running, I configured the Domain Controller with the Splunk Universal Forwarder to collect logs and send them to the Splunk server. This setup is ideal for real-time log analysis and monitoring. I ensured all configurations followed best practices, including static IP assignment, proper account privileges, and user authentication. This lab provided a hands-on demonstration of setting up a SIEM tool, showcasing my abilities to work with Splunk, Linux server environments, and network configuration.
